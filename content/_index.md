# `Francesco Masala`

## `So... who are you? (Or me, depends)`

Hey there! I'm Francesco (Fra to my close friends). I do a lot of interesting and diverse things, from networking to mountain activities, and I'm based in Bolzano/Bozen (the northernmost city of Italy, practically in the middle of nowhere).

I work at [Eurac Research](https://www.eurac.edu/en/people/francesco-masala) as a Sysadmin specialized in networking and cybersecurity. Somehow, I also manage to work at [HyperBit SRLs](https://hyperbit.it/en/about) as a CEO, Sysadmin, Accountant, Cleaner, and Intern - basically doing everything by myself.

In my free time, I help manage the [CNGEI](https://cngei.it) infrastructure and develop/maintain the code and infrastructure for [ApeLab](https://apelab.events).

Last but not least (I promise this monologue is over), I love traveling and exploring mountains.
